# Changelog - Red Hat Family Day 2025 AI Vision Quest

## Version 0.3 - Age-Appropriate Prompts & UX Enhancements

### 🎯 Major Changes

#### Prompt Tuning for Kids Ages 5-10
All game mode prompts have been optimized specifically for children ages 5-10, balancing accuracy with encouragement:

1. **🎨 Colors Mode**
   - Accepts same color family and shades (light/dark variations)
   - Says NO only if completely different color
   - Example: "Show me red" → accepts red, pink, burgundy ✅

2. **🔢 Counting Mode**
   - Tolerates ±1 variance for counting challenges
   - Says NO only if off by more than 2
   - Example: "Show me 3 things" → accepts 2, 3, or 4 items ✅

3. **😊 Emotions Mode**
   - Encourages exaggerated expressions (kids' enthusiasm!)
   - Says NO only if clearly a different emotion
   - Helps kids learn emotional expression

4. **🧘 Yoga Mode**
   - Accepts good attempts (doesn't need perfect form)
   - Says NO only if clearly a completely different pose
   - Focus on trying, not perfection

5. **✋ Body Parts Mode**
   - Clear validation for correct body part visibility
   - Educational but encouraging

6. **🔍 Scavenger Hunt & Actions Mode**
   - Supportive approach for finding objects/doing actions
   - Says NO only if clearly not there or completely wrong

**Philosophy:** "Encouraging and educational" - helps kids learn while keeping the game fun!

#### Editable Prompts During Gameplay
- Prompt text area now remains editable during active game sessions
- Allows real-time prompt tuning based on AI responses
- Parents/facilitators can adjust difficulty on the fly
- Other controls (model, interval, base URL) remain locked for stability

#### Enhanced Modal Notifications
Replaced basic JavaScript `alert()` dialogs with beautiful styled modals:

1. **Design Improvements**
   - Gradient backgrounds matching game theme
   - Smooth pop-in animations with bounce effect
   - Backdrop blur for professional look
   - Consistent styling with leaderboard

2. **Notifications Updated**
   - ⭐ "Already completed challenge" notification
   - ⚠️ "Name required" for leaderboard entry
   - ❌ "Incorrect password" for admin actions

3. **Interaction**
   - Click button to close
   - Click outside modal to dismiss
   - Smooth fade transitions

### 🎮 Prompt Examples

**Before (Strict):**
```
IMPORTANT: If you see red, you MUST start with YES.
```

**After (Balanced for Ages 5-10):**
```
This is for kids ages 5-10 learning colors. Say YES if you see red 
(or similar shades like light/dark red). Be encouraging but accurate - 
they should have the right color family! Say NO if it's a completely 
different color.
```

### 🎨 UX Improvements Summary

| Feature | Before | After |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Color Matching | Exact match only | Color family + shades ✅ |
| Counting Tolerance | None | ±1 acceptable ✅ |
| Yoga Poses | Perfect form required | Good effort accepted ✅ |
| Emotions | Strict | Exaggerations welcomed ✅ |
| Prompt Editing | Locked during game | Always editable ✅ |
| Notifications | Basic alerts | Styled modals ✅ |

### 📝 Technical Details

#### Prompt Engineering Approach
```javascript
// All prompts now include age context
"This is for kids ages 5-10 learning [concept]"

// Encouraging language
"Be encouraging and help them learn!"

// Clear success criteria with tolerance
"Say YES if approximately correct (within ±1 is okay)"

// Reduced false negatives
"Say NO only if significantly off / completely different"
```

### 🎉 Result

The game is now better suited for Family Day:
- ✅ Age-appropriate difficulty (5-10 years old)
- ✅ Balanced between fun and learning
- ✅ Fewer frustrating false negatives
- ✅ More polished, professional UI
- ✅ Flexible for facilitators (editable prompts)

   - Helps kids understand the AI's reasoning

2. **Smarter Validation Logic**
   - Primary: Checks for explicit "YES" at start

### 🔧 Technical Details

#### Prompt Engineering
```
IMPORTANT: If you see [item], you MUST start with YES. If you don't see it, start with NO.

Format: YES - [reason] or NO - [reason]
```

#### Validation Logic
```javascript
// Layer 1: Explicit YES
if (response starts with "YES") → Award points

// Layer 2: Affirmative Inference
if (response contains "holding", "I see", "there is", etc.) → Award points

// Layer 3: Negative Override
if (response contains "no", "not", "don't") → Reject
```

#### Token Limits
- Increased from 50 to 100 tokens for explanation support
- Temperature: 0 (maximum determinism)

### 🎮 Game Experience Improvements

- AI often didn't follow YES/NO format
- False negatives (AI sees item but doesn't say YES)
- Plain alert dialogs
- 2-second delay felt slow

**After:**
- Reliable YES/NO responses with explanations
- Smart inference catches correct answers
- Beautiful themed modals
- 1-second delay keeps kids engaged
